# 🚑 Ambulance Emergency System (DSA)

A **C++ console-based** ambulance dispatch system that finds the **shortest route** to the nearest hospital using **Dijkstra’s algorithm**.  
The system also features an **admin dashboard** to manage emergencies and a **user dashboard** for ambulance requests.

## 🔹 Features

✅ **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** for shortest path calculation  
✅ **Admin Dashboard**: Manage hospitals & sort emergencies  
✅ **User Dashboard**: Call an ambulance & track its route  
✅ **Ambulance System**: Finds the nearest hospital with required treatment  
✅ **Sorting Algorithms** to prioritize emergencies

## 🚀 How It Works

1️⃣ **The admin** manages hospitals & emergency cases.  
2️⃣ **The user** requests an ambulance from any location.  
3️⃣ **The ambulance** finds the **shortest path** to the user.  
4️⃣ **The hospital** is checked for required treatment.  
5️⃣ If treatment is available, **the patient is taken** to that hospital.

## 🏗 Future Improvements

🔹 **GUI version** instead of console-based UI  
🔹 **Machine learning** for hospital load prediction  
🔹 **Real-time location tracking**
