# -Ambulance-Emergency-System-DSA
A C++ console-based ambulance dispatch system that finds the shortest route to the nearest hospital using Dijkstra’s algorithm. The system also features an admin dashboard to manage emergencies and a user dashboard for ambulance requests<br>
🔹 Features
✅ Dijkstra’s Algorithm for shortest path calculation
✅ Admin Dashboard: Manage hospitals & sort emergencies
✅ User Dashboard: Call an ambulance & track its route
✅ Ambulance System: Finds the nearest hospital with required treatment
✅ Sorting Algorithms to prioritize emergencies
<br>
🚀 How It Works<br>
The admin manages hospitals & emergency cases.

The user requests an ambulance from any location.

The ambulance finds the shortest path to the user.

The hospital is checked for required treatment.

If treatment is available, the patient is taken to that hospital.

🏗 Future Improvements
🔹 GUI version instead of console-based UI

🔹 Machine learning for hospital load prediction

🔹 Real-time location tracking
